## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
`TODO://` In the **User Stories section below**, add an `x` in the `-[ ]` like this `- [x]` for any user story you complete. (🚫 Remove this paragraph after after checking off completed user stories)

#### REQUIRED (10pts)

   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [X] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
